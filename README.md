#Getting and Cleaning Data Project
This document provides information on how the documents in this repo satisfy the requirements for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course project. 

In this project data from the accelerometers and gyroscopes of Samsung Galaxy S smartphones of 30 volunteers were retrieved, transformed and cleaned to prepare a tidy data set which one could use for further analysis. 

Briefly, training and test data were merged together to create a new data set, which was then used to create a new tidy data set of the means of each variable for each volunteer performing each activity. 

##Repo contents

* A tidy data set, **tidy_data.txt**, created with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
* A script called **run_Analysis.R** used to create the tidy data set
* A code book, **CodeBook.md** that describes the data, the variables and the transformations performed.
* A **README.md** explaining how the scripts work and how they are connected.
